Oink
====
Oink is an implementation of modern parity game solvers written in C++.
Oink aims to provide high-performance implementations of state-of-the-art
algorithms representing different approaches to solving parity games.

Oink is licensed with the Apache 2.0 license and is aimed at both researchers
and practitioners. For convenience, Oink compiles into a library that can
be used by other projects.

Oink was initially developed (&copy; 2017-2019) by Tom van Dijk and the
[Formal Models and Verification](http://fmv.jku.at/)
group at the Johannes Kepler University Linz as part of the RiSE project,
and now in the [Formal Methods and Tools](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl) group
at the University of Twente.

The main author of Oink is Tom van Dijk who can be reached via <tom@tvandijk.nl>.

Implemented algorithms
----------------------

Oink implements various modern algorithms.

Algorithm       | Description
:-------------- | :----------
NPP  | Priority promotion (bitvector implementation by Benerecetti et al)
PP   | Priority promotion (basic algorithm)
PPP  | Priority promotion PP+ (better reset heuristic)
RR   | Priority promotion RR (even better improved reset heuristic)
DP   | Priority promotion PP+ with the delayed promotion strategy
RRDP | Priority promotion RR with the delayed promotion strategy
ZLK  | (parallel) Zielonka's recursive algorithm
PSI  | (parallel) strategy improvement
TSPM | Traditional small progress measures
SPM  | Accelerated version of small progress measures
MSPM | Maciej Gazda's modified small progress measures
SSPM | Quasi-polynomial time succinct progress measures
QPT  | Quasi-polynomial time ordered progress measures
ZLKQ | Quasi-polynomial time recursive algorithm
FPI  | Distraction-based Fixpoint Iteration
FPJ  | Distraction-based Fixpoint Iteration using Justifications
FPJG | Distraction-based Fixpoint Iteration using Greedy Justifications
TL   | Tangle learning (basic)
ATL  | Tangle learning (alternating)
PTL  | Progressive tangle learning
DTL  | Distraction-free tangle learning

See the TACAS 2018 paper for more details on most of the implemented algorithms. In particular, this paper elaborates on the priority promotion algorithms, the implementation of Zielonka's recursive algorithm, on parallel strategy improvement, on small progress measures and the on QPT ordered progress measures algorithms. Furthermore:

* The accelerated SPM approach is a novel unpublished approach.
* The SSPM succinct progress measures algorithm is by Jurdzinski and Lazic, 2017.
* The QPT recursive algorithm is based on work by Pawel Parys and the follow-up work by Karoliina Lehtinen, Sven Schewe, Dominik Wojtczak.
* FPI is the distraction-based fixpoint algorithm by Tom van Dijk and Bob Rubbens.
* FPJ and FPJG are adaptations of FPI and the Justifications algorithm by Ruben Lapauw et al.
* All tangle learning algorithms are proposed by Tom van Dijk (me).

The parallel algorithms use the work-stealing framework Lace.

The solver can further be tuned using several pre-processors:

1. Removing all self-loops (recommended)
2. Removing winner-controlled winning cycles (recommended)
3. Inflating or compressing the game before solving it
4. SCC decomposition to solve the parity game one SCC at a time.  
   May either improve or deteriorate performance

Tools
-----

Oink comes with several simple tools that are built around the library
liboink.

Main tools:

Tool    | Description
:------ | :-------------
oink    | The main tool for solving parity games
verify  | Small tool that just verifies a solution (can be done by Oink too)
nudge   | Swiss army knife for transforming parity games
dotty   | Small tool that just generates a .dot graph of a parity game

Tools to generate games:

Tool           | Description
:------------- | :----------
rngame         | Faster version of the random game generator of PGSolver
stgame         | Faster version of the steady game generator of PGSolver
counter\_rr    | Counterexample to the RR solver
counter\_dp    | Counterexample to the DP solver
counter\_m     | Counterexample of Maciej Gazda, PhD Thesis, Sec. 3.5
counter\_qpt   | Counterexample of Fearnley et al, An ordered approach to solving parity games in quasi polynomial time and quasi linear space, SPIN 2017
counter\_core  | Counterexample of Benerecetti et al, Robust Exponential Worst Cases for Divide-et-Impera Algorithms for Parity Games, GandALF 2017
counter\_rob   | SCC version of counter\_core.
tc             | Two binary counters generator (game family that defeats many of the recursive algorithms). See https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.305.8 for details.
tc+            | TC modified to defeat the RTL solver

Instructions
-----------

Oink is compiled using CMake.
Optionally, use `ccmake` to set options.
By default, Oink does not compile the extra tools, only the library `liboink` and the tool `oink`.
Oink requires the Boost libraries, in particular `boost_iostreams`.
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && make install
```

Oink provides usage instructions via `oink --help`. Typically, Oink is provided a parity game either
via stdin (default) or from a file. The file may be zipped using the gzip or bzip2 format, which is detected if the
filename ends with `.gz` or `.bz2`.

What you want?                          | But how then?
:-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------
To quickly solve a gzipped parity game: | `oink -v game.pg.gz game.sol`
To verify some solution:                | `oink -v game.pg.gz --sol game.sol`

A typical call to Oink is: `oink [options] [solver] <filename> [solutionfile]`. This reads a parity game from `filename`, solves it with the chosen solver (default: `--npp`), then writes the solution to `<solutionfile>` (default: don't write).
Typical options are:
- `-v` verifies the solution after solving the game.
- `-w <workers>` sets the number of worker threads for parallel solvers. By default, these solvers run their sequential version. Use `-w 0` to automatically determine the maximum number of worker threads.
- `--inflate` and `--compress` inflate/compress the game before solving it.
- `--scc` repeatedly solves a bottom SCC of the parity game.
- `--no-wcwc`, `--no-loops` and `--no-single` disable preprocessors that eliminate winner-controlled winning cycles, self-loops and single-parity games.
- `-z <seconds>` kills the solver after the given time.
- `--sol <filename>` loads a partial or full solution.
- `--dot <dotfile>` writes a .dot file of the game as loaded.
- `-p` writes the vertices won by even/odd to stdout.
- `-t` (once or multiple times) increases verbosity level.
